## Language files

###gettext
To make any changes to the language files(.po, .mo) you will first need to install gettext, 
it can be downloaded from the following site ([gettext link](https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext))
    
To find out how to add translations to your view or templates, you may visit djangos[documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/i18n/translation/)
    
All language files are located in the locale folder, with subfolders corresponding to the language extension(nb, nn etc) 

###Update or create a language
After you have navigated to you project root directory, you can create or update languages using the following command:
    ```
    python manage.py makemessages -l language_code -i env
    ```
Where the language_code is the extension for the language you would like to use, for instance nb is norwegian bokm√•l. 

###Compile messages
After you have made the translations, you can compile them using the following comand. 
    ```
    python manage.py compilemessages
    ```
To compile the new translations, and you are good to go.
