To make any changes to the language files(.po, .mo) you will first need to install gettext,

To find out how to add translations to your view or templates, you may visit djangos[documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/topics/i18n/translation/)

All language files are located in the locale folder, with subfolders corresponding to the language extension(nb, nn etc)

### Update or create a language

After you have navigated to you project root directory, you can create or update languages using the following command:

```
python manage.py makemessages -l language_code -i env
```

And in order to compile Javascript you can use the following command:
```
python -m django-admin makemessages -d djangojs -l language_code
```

Where the language_code is the extension for the language you would like to use, for instance nb is norwegian bokm√•l.

### Compile messages

After you have made the translations, you can compile them using the following command.

```
python manage.py compilemessages
```
